# Applied Data Science Portfolio - Overview

This portfolio highlights 3 projects completed throughout the MS ADS program plus my undergraduate senior thesis, and explains how each contributed to achieving the program's core learning outcomes.

## **Program Learning Outcomes**

### **1. Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable technologies**
Working with diverse data sources and storage systems - including SQL databased, APIs, and flat files (CSV) - to reliably acquire, organize, and retrieve data for analysis.

### **2. Create actionable insight across a range of contexts (e.g. societal, business, political), using data and the full data science life cycle**
Applying problem definition, exploration, cleaning, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation to derive meaningful insights using data.

### **3. Apply visualization and predictive models to help generate actionable insight**
Using tools like ggplot2, Shiny, Python visualisation, tableau and machine learning models to uncover patterns in data and support decisions.

### **4. Use programming languages such as R and Python to support the generation of actionable insight**
Writing reporoducable code in R and Python for data preparation, modeling, feature engineering, and dashboards to produce data-driven insights.

### **5. Communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a broad range of audiences (including project sponsors and technical team lead)**
Translating analytics results into clear visual dashboards, presentations, and written analyses for both technical and non-technical audiences.

### **6. Apply ethics in the development, use and evaluation of data and predictive models (e.g., fairness, bias, transparency, privacy)**
