# Aaron Rofe Blog Post - M.S. in Applied Data Science Program

### Intro
When I started the M.S. in Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University, I felt confident in my foundation from my Sport Analytics undergrad degree that I also got here at Syracuse, but I knew I still had room to grow to make me a more attractive candidate whehn I wanted to look for a job. I wanted to expand my knowledge beyond what I learned in undergrad, push beyond the types of analyses I was doing in sport, and learn how data science is applied across many different domains. I entered the program know how to work with data, but I wanted to learn how to manage an entire data science process from data collection and organization to model and communicating results at a more advanced level. 

### What I expected to learn
Coming into the program, I expected to learn more advanced data science techniques and deep the skills that I had learned in undergrad. I wanted to learn how to work with large and more complex datasets, improve my programming skills in languages such as Python, R and SQL, and improve my knowledge with machine learning algorithms that I learned in undergrad such as gradient boosting. I was also hoping to learn more about database design, data communication, and how to evaluate models in real-world contexts rather than just in classroom examples. Overall, I hoped the program would broaden my skills and prepare me for various analytical tasks faced in a variety of industries.

### What I learned in the Program
The reality ended up exceeding the expectations and instead of learning new techniques, I gained a much clearer sense of the whole data science lifecycle and how all the components from data collection to cleaning to modeling to interpretation all fit together. Throughout the 3 semesters in the program, I learned new tools and methods and how to think like a data scientist. I learned how to design relational databases in the database managment class (IST 659), how to clean and transform messy data, engineer features, build and evaluate predictive models, and communicate my findings to all audiences. I strengthened my programming abilities in R and Python, and I learned how to apply each language to the problem I was solving. Another thing I loved was in IST 707 the Machine Learning class, I learned how much easier and faster it is to run those kinds of ML models in python after trying to do algorithms such as Xgboost in R during undergrad. Courses like IST 707, IST 687, IST 737, MBC 638, SCM 651, and IST 691 helped me understand the technical, and practical aspects of applied analytics and by the end of the program, I felt much more confident in my skills and my ability to work through entie projects.
