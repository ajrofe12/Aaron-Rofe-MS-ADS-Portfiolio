# Applied Data Science Portfolio - Overview

This portfolio highlights 3 projects completed throughout the MS ADS program plus my undergraduate senior thesis, and explains how each contributed to achieving the program's core learning outcomes.

---

## **Program Learning Outcomes**

### **1. Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable technologies**
Working with diverse data sources and storage systems—including SQL databases, APIs, and flat files (CSV)—to reliably acquire, organize, and retrieve data for analysis.

### **2. Create actionable insight across a range of contexts (e.g. societal, business, political), using data and the full data science life cycle**
Applying problem definition, exploration, cleaning, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation to derive meaningful insights using data.

### **3. Apply visualization and predictive models to help generate actionable insight**
Using tools like ggplot2, Shiny, Python visualizations, Tableau, and machine learning models to uncover patterns in data and support decisions.

### **4. Use programming languages such as R and Python to support the generation of actionable insight**
Writing reproducible code in R and Python for data preparation, modeling, feature engineering, and dashboards to produce data-driven insights.

### **5. Communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a broad range of audiences**
Translating analytics results into clear dashboards, presentations, and written analyses for both technical and non-technical audiences.

### **6. Apply ethics in the development, use and evaluation of data and predictive models**
Addressing concerns such as fairness, bias, model transparency, and the appropriate use of sensitive variables when conducting an analysis.

## **High-Level Summaries of Included Projects**

### **1. Residential Energy Usage Shiny App (IST 687)**
Developed an interactive Shiny app and random forest model to classify homes into low, medium, or high energy usage based on more than 200 building, demographic, and climate variables.

### **2. Climate-Commodity Machine Learning Project (IST 707)**
Analyzed climate indicators (temperature, precipitation, anomalies) and their relationships to seven global commodity prices. Built a Python-based pipeline for preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.

### **3. Emergency Hospital Transportation Database (IST 659)**
Designed a full relational database system supporting emergency dispatch workflows. Included ERD diagrams, logical and conceptual models, full project writeup, and final presentation.

### **4. MLB Shirking Thesis (Undergraduate Senior Thesis)**
Used R, Fangraphs/Spotrac data, and GAM models to investigate whether MLB players show reduced performance after signing long-term contracts. Built predictive models for the 2025 free-agent class.

## **How These Projects Demonstrate the Program Learning Outcomes**

### **1. Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable technologies**
- **Climate–Commodity ML Project:** Merged multiple CSV datasets for commodity prices and climate indicators using Python.
- **MLB Shirking Thesis:** Combined baseballr, Fangraphs, and Spotrac data to build a rich multi-year dataset.
- **Energy Usage Shiny App:** Processed a massive household dataset (~8.5M rows) into modeling-ready formats.

---

### **2. Create actionable insight using the full data science lifecycle**
- **Energy Usage Shiny App:** Built and evaluated models inside an interactive dashboard.
- **MLB Shirking Thesis:** Identified salary/contract factors driving performance decline.
- **Climate–Commodity Project:** Identified climate relationships and adapted modeling to account for COVID-19 shocks.
- **Hospital Database:** Designed schemas that improve real-world emergency response workflows.

---

### **3. Apply visualization and predictive models to generate insight**
- **Shiny App:** Random Forest modeling + interactive visualizations.
- **MLB Shirking Thesis:** GAM modeling + exploration of performance trends.
- **Climate–Commodity Project:** Time-series, correlation, and model interpretability visuals.

---

### **4. Use programming languages such as R and Python to support analytics**
- **R:** Shiny App, GAM modeling, preprocessing, and visualization.
- **Python:** Climate-Commodity preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
- **SQL:** Hospital database creation, constraints, relationships, and queries.

---

### **5. Communicate insights to both technical and non-technical audiences**
- **Shiny App:** User-friendly dashboard for model interpretation.
- **Hospital Database:** Conceptual & logical diagrams clarify system design.
- **MLB Shirking Thesis:** Clear writeup explaining modeling choices and results.
- **Climate–Commodity Project:** Notebook documentation summarizing insights.

---

### **6. Apply ethics in data and model development**
- **Shiny App:** Removed leakage-prone features.
- **Hospital Database:** Considered privacy and sensitive information.
- **Climate–Commodity Project:** Avoided overstating conclusions during extreme periods.
- **MLB Shirking Thesis:** Thoughtful handling of demographic and birthplace data.
